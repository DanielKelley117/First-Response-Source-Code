# First-Response-Source-Code
This is the source code for the First Response, my final Raspberry Pi project for Computer Organization. I worked on this project with a partnet named Nathan Smith. The First Response is a handheld device that gives first aid instructions in the event of an emergency. Nathan was primarily responsible for developing the functionality for the search algorithm, and I was primarily responsible for the aesthetic design of the website, the functionality of the webpages, and the assembly of the hardware.
