    <p>Breathing problems could be caused by Allergic Reactions. If this is the case, call 911 immediately and use an epipen.</p>

      <p>To use an epipen, take the cap off the top and stab the victim in the thigh with the other end of the epipen. Do not worry about clothing, as the pen will go right through any article of clothing.</p>
    <p>Usually people with allergies carry their own epipens, but if the victim does not have one, you could use an epipen from someone else who has the same allergy. However, it is best
    to do this only as a last resort.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to perform CPR if the victim is unconscious.</p>

    <h1 data-splitting>Asthma attack</h1>
    <p>Signs of an asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.</p>
    <p>To assist in an asthma attack, use the an inhaler. First take the cap off the inhaler, and place the mouthpiece in the victim's mouth.
    Next, have the victim breath in slowly, and press down on the inhaler. After taking the inhaler out of the victim's mouth, ask the victim to hold their breath for
    10 seconds if they are capable of doing so. Call 911 if the victim's condition does not improve.</p>

    <p>If the victim does not have an inhaler, you can use one from someone else, but it is better to do so as a last resort.</p>
