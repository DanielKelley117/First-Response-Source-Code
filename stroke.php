    <h1 data-splitting>Step 1: Identifying a stroke</h1>
    <p>A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is diminished, causing cell death. Strokes are most common in the elderly, and people with certain conditions,
    typically heart conditions.</p>

      <p>When it comes to responding to a stroke, every second is critical. The victim can usually make a full recovery if their stroke is identified and
      treated within an hour. In order to make sure the victim gets treated by medical personnel immediately, it is important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke.</p>

    <p>Use the abbreviation F.A.S.T. This abbreviation stands for face, arms, speech, and time. If you see someone who you suspect has a stroke, pay close attention
    to their face. If they are having a stroke, half of their face will look droopy, and that will be most noticeable when the victim smiles. Also pay attention to
    their arms. Ask them to place both of their arms in front of them. If they are having a stroke, they will have trouble keeping one of their arms up. Next, ask
    them to speak. If they are having a stroke, their speech will be slurred and strange. Lastly, pay close attention to the time. Find out what time it was when the
    victim started experiencing symptoms. This information will be very helpful for the EMS personnel.</p>
    <p>If you see someone experiencing any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately.</p>

    <h1 data-splitting>Step 2: Treating a stroke</h1>
    <p>If you see someone experiencing a stroke, call 911 at once, and wait for an ambulance. Do not attempt to drive the victim to the hospital yourself
    as the victim must be treated by the EMS personnel in the ambulance vehicle to ensure that they are treated as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>While waiting for EMS personnel to arrive, make the victim as comfortable as you can. Have them sit in a chair and monitor their condition. Do not give them
    anything to eat or drink, and do not give them any medications. Just comfort the victim, and make sure they do not leave.</p>
