    <h1 data-splitting>Step 1: Primary Assessment</h1>
    <p>If you come across someone who appears unconscious, the first thing you will need to do is to perform a primary assessment. It is also important that you alert other
    people to what is going on if you are in a public place.</p>
      <p>First you need to make sure the scene is safe. Move the victim to a new location if the location you are currently in is hazardous. Next you need to check for
      responsiveness. Tap the victim on the shoulders and ask if they are okay. If they respond, try to ask them what happened and call for medical help.</p>
    <p>If the victim is not responsive, check to make sure they are breathing. To do so, place your ear to their mouth and nose with your head facing their stomach.
    While in this position, check to see if you can feel their breath in your hear, and if you can see their chest rise. If the victim is not breathing, check for a pulse.</p>

    <p>To check for a pulse, place your index and middle finger on the victim's neck directly below their head. You will feel their heart beating if they have a pulse.
    If the victim is breathing and has a pulse then call for medical help and monitor the victim's condition. If the victim is not breathing, but has a pulse
    then begin performing rescue breaths. If the victim is not breathing and does not have a pulse, begin CPR. Instructions for the processes mentioned here are below.</p>

    <h1 data-splitting>Step 2: Perofrming Rescue Breaths</h1>
    <p>Before performing rescue breaths, make sure 911 is called. Instruct bystanders to call 911, or call 911 yourself if you are alone. After you ensure that ems
    personnel are on their way, begin performing rescue breaths.</p>
    <img src="img/Rescuebreathimage3.jpg", alt="Rescuebreathimage3", width="500", height="500">
    <p>To perform rescue breaths, tilt the victims head back to open their airway. Place your mouth over the victim's and make a tight seal. Take a deep
    breath and breath into the victim's mouth. Make sure you see the victim's chest rise so that you know you're giving the victim enough air. If the victim
    has become unconscious due to choking, you may need to examine their airway between breaths to check to see if you can clear the airway of the obstruction.</p>

      <h1 data-splitting>Step 3: Perofrming CPR</h1>
      <p>Before performing CPR make sure that 911 has been called. Instruct bystanders to call 911, or call 911 yourself if you are alone. If possible, tell bystanders to
      get an AED as well.Also make sure you clear the victim's chest of all clothing before beginning CPR.</p>

      <p>If the person you are performing CPR on is an infant, then scroll down, as there are special instructions in that case.
      To perform CPR open your left hand and spread your fingers apart, and grab the back of your left hand with your right hand. Place your hands next to the Victim's
      heart, and push down 2 to 2.4 inches for an adult, and 2 inches for a child. This is called a chest compression. Perform 30 chest compressions at a rate of two
      chest compressions per second. This is slightly faster than the rythm of the Bee Gee's 'Stayin Alive.' Afterwards, tilt their head back to open their airway, and place your mouth
      over theirs, creating a tight seal. Give the victim two deep breaths, 6 seconds each. Make sure that the victim's chest rises so that you know they are getting enough air.</p>
      <p>After giving two breaths, give 30 more chest compressions, and continue a cyle of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. If you are with other people,
      have them help you perform CPR. Have one of you give breaths, and the other perform chest compressions, and switch off when each of you get tired.</p>

          <h1 data-splitting>Step 4: Perofrming CPR on an infant, and AEDs</h1>
          <p>Performing CPR on an infant has an important difference. You must use your index and middle finger for chest compressions.</p>
          <img src="img/AEDimage1.jpg", alt="AEDimage1", width="500", height="500">
          <p>An AED is an Automated External Defibrilator, and it is helpful in cases when a victim has no pulse. AEDs usually have instructions. Attach the AED pads to the victim's bare chest.
          Make sure the pads are not touching each other, or touching anything metal the victim may have on them. If the victim is an infant, you may need to put one pad on the front, and one on the back.
          Follow the instructions of the AED after turning it on, and make sure everyone stands clear of the victim when the AED is about to deliver a shock.</p>
